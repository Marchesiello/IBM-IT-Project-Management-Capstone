# Scenario: Develop an Application (App) to Provide Real-Time Marketing Data

Good news! The project charter and stakeholder register have been approved. The Project Management Institute (PMI) recommends that scope, schedule, and cost be planned in this order during initial baseline planning. Your team will follow this recommendation.

The project charter divided the project into five phases for scheduling purposes. The project team has decided to tailor the work breakdown structure (WBS), schedule, and high-level budget estimate using these phases.

The table below identifies each phase and tasks to be considered in the scope, schedule, and cost planning for this project. Note that the key task requirements for the major tasks are not listed in the order in which they will occur. When planning scope, schedule, and cost, your team must determine the task flow.

Project Phase	Key Task Requirements
Design (30 days)	
Gain final design approval
Identify vendor to design and develop app
Solicit initial design feedback
Define key app functionality requirements
Develop initial design
Finalize vendor contract
Update design based on feedback
Development (90 days)	
Perform prototype beta test
Develop an initial prototype
Develop an app launch plan
Update prototype based on feedback
Implement IT upgrades
Solicit beta test feedback
Gain prototype sign-off
Test (30 days)	
Test the final app prototype
Begin full-scale development
Begin IT hiring
Gain customer acceptance
Approve the launch plan
Train Marketing personnel on a new app
Launch and approve the app (60 days)	
Monitor app performance
Plan v2 upgrades
Launch a new app
Finalize new hires
Plan app upgrades
Implement app upgrades
Launch app v2
Document app issues
Complete the final project report
The team determined that direct costs will be required as follows:

App development: Design Phase 50%, launch and improve app 50%
IT software and hardware: Development phase
IT storage: Test phase
Data feeds: Development phase
App security upgrades: Test phase
IT personnel HR costs: Launch phase
All personnel costs are considered indirect. The organization bears training costs, and are also indirect.

# Scenario: Develop an Application (App) to Provide Real-Time Marketing Data

Good news! Your work breakdown structure (WBS), project network diagram, and high-level budget have been approved. It's now time to begin project support planning. You have met with your sponsor Mary Smithers, and she has emphasized the need for a robust quality management program to ensure that the project meets requirements and creates an app that fits the purpose. This requires an effective quality assurance program for all phases of the project and quality control to ensure that all project deliverables are free of defects.

One of your key team members, Keiko Tanaka, stated she is well-versed in quality assurance and quality control processes. Priya Service from IT and Ram Samuels from Marketing stated that they would like to act as subject matter experts to ensure the quality of app development and IT support activities. It was determined that an external vendor would be brought on board to work with the internal development team on app development.

Mary also emphasized the need for effective communication. She called for weekly status meetings to include all key stakeholders. She also recommended establishing a change control board (CCB). Mary requested that you meet with her weekly in her office to discuss the project. She also stressed the need for solid communication throughout the project's procurement process.

Mary strongly believes that if you fail to manage the risk, the risk will manage you. She would like to see a comprehensive risk register that addresses both threats and opportunities. Mary has concerns about the availability of feedback, the ability to hire the talent she needs, and the availability of quality training.

It's time to get to work!
